A collection of cryptographic schemes implemented in python

## LFSR
###### Linear Feedback Shift Register

Definition. A linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register in which some of its outputs are connected to the input through some logic gates (typically, an XOR). Various bit patterns can be generated inexpensively, including pseudo-random sequences.

## DES
###### Data Encryption Standard

The Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for encrypting digital data. Although its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for modern applications, it has been highly influential in advancing cryptography.

## AES
###### Advanced Encryption Standard

The Advanced Encryption Standard, also known by its original name Rijndael, is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2001.
